## The collection

### Agentic AI

> Agentic AI is "models using tools in loops".

### AI coding

> The most important question becomes less about "how to build" something,
> but more about "what to build".

> Ultimately, it comes down to taste. It comes down to trying to expose
> yourself to the best things that humans have done and then try to bring
> those things into what you're doing. (Steve Jobs)

### Language and intelligence

> Language is but a projection of intelligence onto the token space.
> Reasoning confined to tokens is inherently suboptimal - a shadow of
> the latent space where intelligence truly resides.

### AGI

> Some say "AGI is imminent", some say "AGI is impossible",
> the reality is probably somewhere in between.
